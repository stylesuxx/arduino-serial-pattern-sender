# Arduino Serial pattern generator

This is just a small sketch mainly to have a reference for measuring serial output with an oscilloscope.
It sends a user selectable pattern(default: "Q") in a selectable baudrate(default: 9600) and a delay(default: 10ms) on pin 11.
The baudrate, pattern and delay may be changed during runtime.
The output pin has to be changed in the sketch if you don't want to use pin 11.
